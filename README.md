# RealBattery Recharged

**RealBattery Recharged** is a complete overhaul of the stock electric system in Kerbal Space Program, originally designed by Blackliner. 
It brings a more realistic and engaging battery simulation, adding depth to spacecraft design and power management without overcomplicating gameplay.

## Features

*RealBattery Recharged* replaces the simplistic stock EC storage system with a more nuanced model: batteries **store energy** (StoredCharge) and **supply power** (ElectricCharge) up to their rated capacity.  
Discharge and recharge occur dynamically based on system demand, charge level, and efficiency.

Each battery reports its energy/power density, charge/discharge efficiency, current state (Idle / Charging / Discharging), and more.  
The new system rewards thoughtful planning, buffering for peak loads, and progressive tech improvements.

### This mod includes:
- A dynamic battery module applied to all parts containing ElectricCharge
- Realistic simulation of power (kW) and energy (kWh), based on internal capacity and output limits
- Discharge and recharge mechanics with efficiency losses and power buffering
- A range of battery chemistries inspired by real-world technologies
- Tech-tree progression with unlockable battery upgrades per part
- Seamless integration with B9PartSwitch and localization support
- Optional language files to rename ElectricCharge and StoredCharge

### Extras
Optional patches are included in the release to enhance immersion and realism. Extra patches are modular and can be removed or disabled if undesired:

- **Alternator Fix**: disables alternators on most rocket engines (for realism), but enables them on multi-mode engines like the *RAPIER*.
- **EC-to-current** and **EC-to-kW** localization packs: rename *Electric Charge* to *Electric Current*, or alternatively to *kW/kWh* (replacing EC/SC with power units). **Only install one at a time!** See the wiki for details.
- **Electric-pump-fed Engines**: the *Goldfish* and *Angora* engines from Near Future Launch Vehicles now require electric charge to operate.
- **Fuel Cell Output**: fuel cells internal buffer aligns with actual electrical output.

To install an extra, simply place the corresponding patch into your `GameData` folder. See the `Extras/` folder in the release package for details.

## Planned Features

Several improvements and expansions are planned for future updates:

- [x] Adjustable settings in the difficulty menu
- [x] Ability to manually enable/disable individual batteries
- [x] Background simulation support for unloaded vessels
- [x] Battery obsolescence system (degradation over time)
- [x] Self-discharge for inactive batteries
- [x] Thermal behavior (heat production and damage, SystemHeat integration)
- [ ] Fix battery stats not updating correctly when switching subtypes in the editor
- [x] Refine background simulation for improved accuracy and broader compatibility with third-party modules  
- [ ] Add texture switching support for stock and stockalike battery parts  
- [ ] Create a custom KSPedia page for in-game documentation

## Dependencies

### Required:
- Module Manager
- B9PartSwitch
- Community Resource Pack
- SystemHeat

### Suggested:

## Installation

1. Remove any previous `RealBattery` install.
3. Download the latest release from the Releases page.
2. Extract into your `GameData` folder.
4. Ensure dependencies are installed.
5. (Optional) Install the extras as you like.

> Starting a new save is recommended to enjoy the full tech progression. Installing mid-career is possible, but may affect in-flight vessels' power balance.

## External Mod Compatibility

RealBattery Recharged dynamically applies to any part with ElectricCharge, including most modded parts.  
Known compatibility or special support includes:

- Airplane Plus
- Planetside Exploration Technologies
- Artemis Construction Kit
- Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit
- Buran Orbiter Construction Kit
- Bluedog Design Bureau
- HabTech 2
