        #LOC_RB_descDet_PbAc = Lead-acid is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Rugged, cheap and predictable, but heavy and inefficient. Perfect if you are in no hurry (or have no alternatives).

        #LOC_RB_short_AgOx = Ag-Ox
        #LOC_RB_descSum_AgOx = <#FF0000>Not rechargeable</color> \nSelf-discharge: 7.5%/month \nThermal loss: 30%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_AgOx = A simple high energy density battery, used since the first space flights. Great power, but for a single use.

        #LOC_RB_short_AgZn = Ag-Zn
        #LOC_RB_descSum_AgZn = Durability: 50 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 7.5%/month \nThermal loss: 30%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_AgZn = Rechargeable evolution of silver oxide batteries. Powerful (and expensive) like a small rocket! Great for quick discharges, but don't expect it to last long.

        #LOC_RB_title_NiZn = Nickel-Zinc
        #LOC_RB_short_NiZn = NiZn
        #LOC_RB_descSum_NiZn = Durability: 500 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 30%/month \nThermal loss: 15%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_AgZn = A robust early tech battery with higher voltage and energy density than NiCd or NiMH. Offers solid performance at moderate cost, but suffers from lower cycle life and increased heat at full charge.

        #LOC_RB_title_NiCd = Nickel-Cadmium
        #LOC_RB_short_NiCd = NiCd
        #LOC_RB_descSum_NiCd = Durability: 500 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 10%/month \nThermal loss: 20%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_NiCd = Nickel batteries are rugged and reliable, making them a cost-effective and well-balanced choice for a variety of uses. The main drawback is that they donâ€™t excel at anything.

        #LOC_RB_title_NiH2 = Nickel-Hydrogen
        #LOC_RB_short_NiH2 = NiH2
        #LOC_RB_descSum_NiH2 = Durability: 20,000 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 50%/month \nThermal loss: 15%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_NiH2 = Compared to other rechargeable batteries, a nickel-hydrogen battery provides good specific energy and a very long operating life, making it perfect for monitoring satellites and other long-duration missions.

        #LOC_RB_title_Li_ion = Lithium-Ion
        #LOC_RB_short_Li_ion = Li-Ion
        #LOC_RB_descSum_Li_ion = Durability: 1,000 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 3%/month \nThermal loss: 15%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_Li_ion = This rechargeable battery offers an excellent balance between energy density, weight and life cycles. It requires careful thermal management, but has revolutionized energy storage in modern space systems.

        #LOC_RB_title_Li_poly = Lithium-Polymer
        #LOC_RB_short_Li_poly = Li-Poly
        #LOC_RB_descSum_Li_poly = Durability: 500 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 5%/month \nThermal loss: 25%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_Li_poly = A flexible and compact variant of lithium-ion cells, perfect for lightweight probes and drones. Don't heat it. Never.

        #LOC_RB_title_Graphene = Graphene
        #LOC_RB_descSum_Graphene = Durability: 25,000 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 0.1%/month \nThermal loss: 3%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_Graphene = A two-dimensional network of carbon and silicon that promises lightweight, ultra-capacious batteries with lightning-fast response times. Expensive? Yes. Exaggerated? Also. But who has ever won while staying within the limits?
        
        #LOC_RB_title_SSB = Solid-State Battery
        #LOC_RB_short_SSB = SSB
        #LOC_RB_descSum_SSB = Durability: 10,000 cycles \nSelf-discharge: 1%/month \nThermal loss: 5%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_SSB = The final frontier: no liquids, no explosions (maybe). Stellar performance, thermal stability, and a price that will make accountants weep.

        #LOC_RB_title_TBat = Thermal
        #LOC_RB_short_TBat = TBat
        #LOC_RB_descSum_TBat = <#FF0000>Not rechargeable</color> \nSelf-discharge: 0% \nThermal loss: 60%
        #LOC_RB_descDet_TBat = Inactive at room temperature, activated by a pyrotechnic charge. Very high power density for short durations, making it particularly suitable for atmospheric probes and all the things that would explode anyway.
