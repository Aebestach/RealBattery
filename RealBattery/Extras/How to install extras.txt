# HOT TO INSTALL AN EXTRA:

## Patches:
Just open the folder of the extra feature you like, and copy-paste the patch it to your 'GameData\RealBattery\patches' folder.

   - 'Extra_AlternatorFix': rocket engines won't have alternators anymore, but multimodal ones (like Rapier) will
   - 'Extra_Electric-pump-fedEngines': some Near Future Launch Vehicles rocket engines will require EC to run
   - 'Extra_FuelCellOutput': Electric Charge capacity in fuel cells will meet their actual output

## Rename resources:
Open ONLY ONE and paste the '002_RealBatteryRename' folder into 'GameData'. If you install both, they will overwrite each other.

   - 'EC-to-current': just renames "Electric Charge" to "Electric Current"
   - 'EC-to-kW': renames "Electric Charge" to "Electric Current", "EC/s" to "kW" and "SC" to "kWh"
